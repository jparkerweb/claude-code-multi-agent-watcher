# PROVIDER DETAILS
# ==============================
# Anthropic: Uses Claude 3.5 Haiku (fast, high-quality)
# OpenRouter: Access to various models (cost-effective, flexible)
# 
# Fallback behavior: If primary provider fails, system attempts fallback to alternative
# Graceful degradation: Events are captured even if summarization fails
